## Installation

## What Is Updated From The Original

This repository now reflects a fully modernized implementation of ClipMenu. Major updates include:

- Replaced legacy polling-style clipboard handling with an event-driven clipboard pipeline.
- Adopted Combine-based publishers/observation in the app flow for reactive updates.
- Migrated persistence to SwiftData models and services.
- Completed end-to-end implementation of the Actions menu, including action execution wiring in the modern app.
- Rebuilt the app architecture in Swift with SwiftUI scenes and a generated Xcode project workflow.
